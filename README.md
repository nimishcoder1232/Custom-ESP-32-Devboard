# Custom-ESP-32-Devboard
In this project, I created an ESP32-S3 Wroom devboard. This is inspired by the BL=blueprint custom devboard project, but I used ESP 32 instead of RP2040, because of how much more powerful ESP 32 is, while not being more expensive.  

I made this project to learn about PCB design, and Learn how to work with ESP32. It was also extremely fun. 

This project has a KICAD file that allows you to edit the PCB, but the Gerber file is enough to get the PCB manufactured. You can use the BOM to know what parts to buy from DigiKey.
